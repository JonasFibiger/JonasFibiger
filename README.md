## Hi there 👋 I'm Jonas

I'm a software developer, automation architect, and CTO at [LÖFT Consulting](https://www.loftconsulting.dk), where we accelerate the digital and sustainable transformation of the construction and real estate industry.

### 🚀 What I do

I work at the intersection of **technology, psychology, and strategy**, turning complex problems into functional, scalable solutions. My work typically involves:

- ✨ Building AI-driven workflows and automations (Make.com, GPT, Fireflies, Zapier)
- 🧠 Designing digital strategies with a human-centered perspective.
- 🛠️ Developing functional fullstack platforms (Supabase, Next.js, Tailwind)
- 🧩 Creating beautiful and intuitive UIs and user onboarding flows
- 🧾 Automating ESG reporting and data processes in legacy-heavy industries
- 📦 Managing SaaS and CRM systems for consultants and SMBs
- 💡 Advising clients on the twin transition: digital + sustainable

### 👨‍💻 CTO @ LÖFT

At LÖFT, I lead the technical development of solutions that make it easier for SMEs in construction to compete through smart tech. That means automating what can be automated – and understanding what shouldn't be. I focus on bridging strategy and implementation so that tech actually gets used.

### 🌍 Side projects

- **Bluprintz**: Helping over 20 clients build no-code automations and websites  
- **Harmonix**: Co-founder of a music platform connecting 150+ singers, also used for corporate team-building through music  
- Occasional freelance work with AI solutions, UI/UX design, and automation systems

### 🎶 Music is my second language

Outside of tech, I'm also a pianist and songwriter. I believe the best ideas often emerge when logic meets intuition.
